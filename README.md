I test,
and I automate

If I spot a task worth automating;
I'll automate it

If not;
I'll manually test the crap out of the system
And I'll smash bugs that you may not even see in your ugliest dreams

I'm not the most careful person;
But I will always find a way to break your system
Yet will recommend solutions to fix it
Be not afraid
