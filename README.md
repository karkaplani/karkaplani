### Hey folks! ðŸ‘‹

This is Apo, a full-time non-stop programming passionest (Yeah I make up words). 

- Besides Java, Linux, Database and Android Development courses that I've been learning in school, I tried to teach myself Kotlin, Unity with C#, and HTML5 Canvas for game development, and made some projects. 
- Nowadays, I have settled down and I'm battling with MERN stack to make a full-stack and efficient real man project as well as I'm teaching programming as a peer tutor in Algonquin. 
- I enjoy working with both frontend and backend, and I'm looking to collaborate on full-stack web projects.

Happy coding!
